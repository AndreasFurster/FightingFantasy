<h1>HOW TO FIGHT THE CREATURES OF DEATHTRAP DUNGEON</h1>
<p>
	Before embarking on your adventure, you must first
	determine your own strengths and weaknesses
	You have in your possession a sword and a backpack
	containing provisions (food and drink) for the
	trip. You have been preparing for your quest by
	training yourself in swordplay and erercising vigorously to build up your stamina.
</p>
<p>
	To see how effective your preparations have been
	you must use the dice to determine your initial
	skill and stamina scores, On pages 18-19 there is
	an Adventure Sheet which you may use to record the
	details of an adventure. On it you will findboxes for
	recording your skill and stamina scores,
</p>
<p>
	You are advised to either record your scores on the
	Adventure Sheet in pencil, or make photocopies of
	the page to use in future adventures.
</p>
<h2>Skill Stamina and Luck</h2>
<p> 
	Roll one die. Add 6 to this number and enter this
	total in the sKill box of the Adventure Sheet
	Roll both dice. Add 12 to the number rolled and
	enter this total in the stamina box.
	There is also a luck box. Roll one die, add 6 to this
	number and enter this total in the Luckbox.
</p>
<p>
	For reasons that will be explained below, skill,
	stamina and luck scores change constantly during an
	adventure. You must keep an accurate record
	of these scores and for this reason you are advised
	either to write small in the boxes or to keep an eraser
	handy. But never rub out your initial scores.
	Although you may be awarded additional skill,
	stamina and luck points, these totals may never
	exceed your intial scores, except on very rare occasions,
	when you will be instructed on a particular
	Page.
</p>
<p>
	Your skill score reflects your swordsmanship and
	general fighting expertise; the higher the better.
	Your stamina score reflects your general constitution,
	your will to survive, your determination
	and overallfitness; the higher your stamina score,
	the longer you will be able to survive. Your Luck
	score indicates how naturally lucky a person you
	are. Luck - and magic - are facts of life in the fantasy
	kingdom you are about to explore.
</p>
<h2>Battles</h2>
<p>You will often come across pages in the book which
	instruct you to fight a creature of some sort. An
	option to flee may be given, but if not or if you
	choose to attack the creature anyway you must
	resolve the batde as described below.
</p>
<p>
	First record the creature's skill and stamina
	scores in the firt vacant Monster Encounter Box on
	your adventure Sheet The scores for each creature
	are given in the book each time you have an encounter.
	The sequence of combat is then:			
</p>
<p>
	1 Roll both dice once for the creature. Add its
	skill score. This total is the creature's Attack
	Strength.
	2. Roll both dice once for yourself. Add the number
	rolled to your current skill score This total is
	your Attack Strength.
	3. If your Attack Strength is higher than that of the
	creature, you have wounded it. Proceed to step
	4. If the creature's Attack Strength is higher than
	yours, it has wounded you Proceed to step 5- If
	both Attack Strength totals are the same, you
	have avoided each others blows - start the next
	Attack Round from step l above.
	4. You have wounded the creature, so substract 2
	points ftom its stamina score. You may use
	your luck here to do additional damage (see
	over).
	5. The creature has wounded you, so substract 2
	points ftom your own stamina score. Again
	you may use luck at this stage (see over).
	6. Make the appropriate adjustments to either the
	ceature's or your own stamina scores (and
	your luck score if you used luck see over).
	7. Begin the next Attack Round by returning to
	your current skill score and repeating steps
	1-6. This sqquence continues until the stamina
	score of either you or tlte creature you are
	fighting has been reduced to zero (death).
</p>
<h2>Escaping</h2>
<p>
	On some pages you may be given the option of
	running away from a battle should things be going
	badly for you. However, if you do run away, then
	ceature automatically gets in one wound on you
	(subtract 2 stamina points) as you flee. Such is the
	price of cowardice, Note that you may use luck on
	this wound in the normal way (see below). You may
	only Escape if that option is specifically given to you
	on the page.
</p>
<h2>Fighting more then one creature</h2>
<p>
	If you come across more than one creature in a
	particular encounter the instructions on that page
	will tell you how to handle the battle Sometimes
	you will treat them as a single monster; sometimes
	you will fight each one in turn.
</p>
<h2>Luck</h2>
<p>
	At various times during your adventure, either in
	battles or when you come across situations in which
	you could either be lucky or unlucky (details of
	these are given on the pages themselves), you may
	call on vour luck to make the outcome more favourable. 
	But beware! Using luck is a risky business and
	if you are unlucky, the rcsults could be disastrous The
	procedure for using your luck is as follows: roll
	two dice. lf the number rolled is eaual to or less than
	your current luck score, you have been lucky and
	the result will go in your favour. If the number
	rolled is higher than your cullent Luck score, you
	have been unlucky and you will be penalized.
	This procedure is known as Testing your Luck. Each
	time yo|u Test your Luck, you must subtract one point
	from your curent luck score, Thus you will soon
	realize that the more you rely on your luck, the more
	risky this will become
</p>
<h2>Using luck in battles</h2>
<p>
	On certain pages of the book you will be told to Test
	your Luck and will be told the consequences of your
	being lucky or unlucky. However, in battles, you
	always have the option of using your luck either to
	inflict a more serious wound on a creature you have
	just wounded, or to minimize the effects of a wound
	the creature has just inflicted on you.
	lf you have just wounded the creature, you may test
	your Luck as described above. If you are lucky, you
	have inflicted a severe wound and may subtract an
	extra 2 points from the cleature's stamina score.
	However, if you are unlucky, the wound was a mere
	graze and you must restore 1 point to the creature's
	stamina (i. e. instead of scoring the normal 2 points
	of damage, you have now scored only 1).
	If the creature has just wounded you, you may Test
	your Luck to try to minimize the wound. If you are
	lucky, you have managed to avoid the full damage
	of the blow. Restore 1 point of stamina (i.e. instead
	of doing 2 points of damage it has done only 1) if
	you are unlucky, you have taken a more serious
	blow- Subtract 1 extra stamina point.
	Remember that you must subtract 1 point ftom your
	own luck score each time you. Test your Luck
</p>
<h2>Restoring skill, stamina and luck</h2>
<h3>Skill</h3>
<p>
	Your skill score will not change much during your
	adventure- Occasionally, a page may give instructions
	to increase ot decrease your skill score. A
	Magic Weapon may increase your skill, but remember
	that only one weapon can be used at a time
	You cannot claim 2 skill bonuses for carrying two
	Magic Swords. Your skill score can never exceed
	its initial value unless specifically instructed. Drinking
	the Potion of Skill (see later) will restore your
	skill to its initial level at any time.
</p>
<h3>Stamina</h3>
<p>
	Your stamina score will change a lot during your
	adventure as you fight monster and undertake
	various tasks, As you near your goal, your stamina
	level may be dangerously low and battles may
	be particularly risky, so be carefull
	Your backpack contains enough Provisions for ten
	meals. You may rest and eat at any time except
	when engaged in a Battle. Eahng a meal restores 4
	stamina points. When you eat a meal, add 4 Points
	to your stamina score and deduct 1 point from
	your Provisions. A separate Provisions Remaining
	box is provided on the Adventure Sheet for recording
	details of Provisions. Remember that you have a
	long way to Bo, so use your Provisions wisely!
	Remember also that your stamina score may never
	exceed its initial value unless specilically instructed
	on a page. Drinking the Potion of Strength (see
	later) will restore your stamina to its initial level at
	any time
</p>
<h3>luck</h3>
<p>
	Additions to your luck score are awarded through
	the adventure when you have been particularly
	lucky Details are given on the Pages of the book.
	Remember that, as with skill and stamina, your
	luck score may never exceed its initial value unless
	specifically instructed on a page. Dinking the
	Potion of Fortune (see later) will restore your Luck
	to its initial level at any time, and increase your
	initial luck by 1 point.
</p>
<h1>EQUIPMENT AND POTIONS</h1>
<p>
	You will start your adventure with a bare minimum
	of equipment, but you may find or buy other items
	during your travels. You are armed with a sword
	and are dressed in leather armour. You have a
	backpack to hold your Provisions and any treasures
	you may come across
	In addition, you may take one bottle of a magical
	potion which will aid you on your quest. You may
	choose to take a bottle of any of the following:
	</p>
	<p>
	A Potion of Skill- restores skill points<br/>
	A Potion of Strength restores stamina points<br/>
	A Potion of Fortune restores luck points and
	adds 1 to initial luck
	</p>
	These potions maybe taken at any time during your
	adventure (except when engaged in a Battle). Taking
	a measure of potion will restore skill, stamina
	or Luck scores to their initial level (and the Potion of
	Forfune will add 1 point to your initial luck score
	before luck is restored).
	Each bottle of potion contains enough for one measure,
	i.e. the characteristic may be restored once
	during an adventure. Make a note on your Adventure
	sheet when you have used up a potion.
	Remember also that you may only choose ore of the
	three potions to take on your trip, so choose wisely!
</p>
<h1>HINTS ON PLAY</h1>
<p>
	There is one true way through Deathtrap Dungeon
	and it will take you several attempts to find it. 
	Make notes and draw a map asyou explore this map will
	be invaluable in future advenfures and enable you
	to progress rapidly through to unexplored sections.
	Not all areas contain treasure; many merely contain
	traps and creatures which you will no doubtfallfoul
	of. There are many'wild goose chase'Passages and
	while you may indeed ptogress through to your
	ultimate destination, it is by no means certain that
	you will find what you are searching for.
	It will be realized that entnes make no sense if read
	in numencal order. ltis essential that you read only
	theentries you are instructed to read. Reading other
	entries will only cause confuslon and may less-en the
	excitement during Play.
	The one true way involves a minimum of dsk and
	any player, no matter how weak on initial dice rolls,
	should be able to get through fairly easily.<br/><br/>
	May the luck of the gods go with you on the adventure
	ahead!
