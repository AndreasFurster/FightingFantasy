		<h1>HOW TO FIGHT THE CREATURESOF DEATHTRAP DUNGEON</h1>
			<P>Before embarking on your adventure, you must first
				determine your own strengths and weaknesses
				You have in your possession a sword and a backpack
				containing provisions ({ood and drink) for the
				trip. You have been preparing for your quest by
				training yourself in swordplay and erercising vigorously to build up your stamina.
				<br/><br/>
				To see how effective your preparations have been
				you must use the dice to determine your initial
				skill and stamina scores, On pages 18-19 there is
				an Adventure Sheet which you may use to record the
				dâ‚¬tails of an adventure. On it you will findboxes for
				recording your skill and stamina scores,
				<br/><br/>
				You are advised to either record your scores on the
				Adventure Sheet in pencil, or make photocopies of
				the page to use in future adventures.
				</P>
				<br/><br/>

		<h1>Skill Stamina and Luck</h1>
			<p> Roll one die. Add 6 to this number and enter this
				total in the sKill box of the Adventure Sheet
				Roll both dice. Add 12 to the number rolled and
				enter this total in the stamina box.
				There is also a luck box. Roll one die, add 6 to this
				number and enter this total in the Luckbox.
				<br/><br/>
				For reasons that will be explained below, skill,
				stamina and luck scores change constantly during an
				adventure. You must keep an accurate record
				of these scores and for this reason you are advised
				either to write small in the boxes or to keep an eraser
				handy. But never rub out your initial scores.
				Although you may be awarded additional skill,
				stamina and luck points, these totals may never
				exceed your intial scores, except on very rare occasions,
				when you will be instructed on a particular
				Page.
				<br/><br/>
				Your skill score reflects your swordsmanship and
				general fighting expertise; the higher the better.
				Your stamina score reflects your general constitution,
				your will to survive, your determination
				and overallfitness; the higher your stamina score,
				the longer you will be able to survive. Your Luck
				score indicates how naturally lucky a person you
				are. Luck - and magic - are facts of life in the fantasy
				kingdom you are about to explore.
				</p>
				<br/><br/>

		<h1>Battles</h1>
			<p>You will often come across pages in the book which
				instruct you to fight a creature of some sort. An
				option to flee may be given, but if not or if you
				choose to attack the creature anyway you must
				resolve the batde as described below.
				<br/><br/>
				First record the creature's skill and stamina
				scores in the firt vacant Monster Encounter Box on
				your adventure Sheet The scores for each creature
				are given in the book each time you have an encounter.
				The sequence of combat is then:
