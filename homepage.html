<h1>HOW TO FIGHT THE CREATURESOF DEATHTRAP DUNGEON</h1>
<p>
	Before embarking on your adventure, you must first
	determine your own strengths and weaknesses
	You have in your possession a sword and a backpack
	containing provisions ({ood and drink) for the
	trip. You have been preparing for your quest by
	training yourself in swordplay and erercising vigorously to build up your stamina.
</p>
<p>
	To see how effective your preparations have been
	you must use the dice to determine your initial
	skill and stamina scores, On pages 18-19 there is
	an Adventure Sheet which you may use to record the
	dâ‚¬tails of an adventure. On it you will findboxes for
	recording your skill and stamina scores,
</p>
<p>
	You are advised to either record your scores on the
	Adventure Sheet in pencil, or make photocopies of
	the page to use in future adventures.
</p>
<h2>Skill Stamina and Luck</h2>
<p> 
	Roll one die. Add 6 to this number and enter this
	total in the sKill box of the Adventure Sheet
	Roll both dice. Add 12 to the number rolled and
	enter this total in the stamina box.
	There is also a luck box. Roll one die, add 6 to this
	number and enter this total in the Luckbox.
</p>
<p>
	For reasons that will be explained below, skill,
	stamina and luck scores change constantly during an
	adventure. You must keep an accurate record
	of these scores and for this reason you are advised
	either to write small in the boxes or to keep an eraser
	handy. But never rub out your initial scores.
	Although you may be awarded additional skill,
	stamina and luck points, these totals may never
	exceed your intial scores, except on very rare occasions,
	when you will be instructed on a particular
	Page.
</p>
<p>
	Your skill score reflects your swordsmanship and
	general fighting expertise; the higher the better.
	Your stamina score reflects your general constitution,
	your will to survive, your determination
	and overallfitness; the higher your stamina score,
	the longer you will be able to survive. Your Luck
	score indicates how naturally lucky a person you
	are. Luck - and magic - are facts of life in the fantasy
	kingdom you are about to explore.
</p>
<h2>Battles</h2>
<p>You will often come across pages in the book which
	instruct you to fight a creature of some sort. An
	option to flee may be given, but if not or if you
	choose to attack the creature anyway you must
	resolve the batde as described below.
</p>
<p>
	First record the creature's skill and stamina
	scores in the firt vacant Monster Encounter Box on
	your adventure Sheet The scores for each creature
	are given in the book each time you have an encounter.
	The sequence of combat is then:			
</p>
<p>
	1 Roll both dice once for the creature. Add its
	skill score. This total is the creature's Attack
	Strength.
	2. Roll both dice once for yourself. Add the number
	rolled to your current skill score This total is
	your Attack Strength.
	3. If your Attack Strength is higher than that of the
	creature, you have wounded it. Proceed to step
	4. If the creature's Attack Strength is higher than
	yours, it has wounded you Proceed to step 5- If
	both Attack Strength totals are the same, you
	have avoided each others blows - start the next
	Attack Round from step l above.
	4. You have wounded the creature, so substract 2
	points ftom its stamina score. You may use
	your luck here to do additional damage (see
	over).
	5. The creature has wounded you, so substract 2
	points ftom your own stamina score. Again
	you may use luck at this stage (see over).
	6. Make the appropriate adjustments to either the
	ceature's or your own stamina scores (and
	your luck score if you used luck see over).
	7. Begin the next Attack Round by returning to
	your current skill score and repeating steps
	1-6. This sqquence continues until the stamina
	score of either you or tlte creature you are
	fighting has been reduced to zero (death).
</p>
<h2>Escaping</h2>
<p>
	On some pages you may be given the option of
	running away from a battle should things be going
	badly for you. However, if you do run away, then
	ceature automatically gets in one wound on you
	(subtract 2 stamina points) as you flee. Such is the
	price of cowardice, Note that you may use luck on
	this wound in the normal way (see below). You may
	only Escape if that option is specifically given to you
	on the page.
</p>
<h2>Fighting more then one creature</h2>
<p>
	If you come across more than one creature in a
	particular encounter the instructions on that page
	will tell you how to handle the battle Sometimes
	you will treat them as a single monster; sometimes
	you will fight each one in turn.
</p>
<h2>Luck</h2>
<p>
	At various times during your adventure, either in
	battles or when you come across situations in which
	you could either be lucky or unlucky (details of
	these are given on the pages themselves), you may
	call on vour luck to make the outcome more favourable. 
	But beware! Using luck is a risky business and
	if you are unlucky, the rcsults could be disastrous The
	procedure for using your luck is as follows: roll
	two dice. lf the number rolled is eaual to or less than
	your current luck score, you have been lucky and
	the result will go in your favour. If the number
	rolled is higher than your cullent Luck score, you
	have been unlucky and you will be penalized.
	This procedure is known as Testing your Luck. Each
	time yo|u Test your Luck, you must subtract one point
	from your curent luck score, Thus you will soon
	realize that the more you rely on your luck, the more
	risky this will become
